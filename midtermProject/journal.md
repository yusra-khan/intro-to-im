## Mid-term Project Journal

I plan to make a single-player space shooter game. There will be the initial homescreen with buttons for instructions and play.
The game play:
- The player will control a spaceship using the left and right arrow keys
- Background will be moving to give the illusion of forward motion
- Bullets will be fired using up arrow key
- There will be enemy spaceships randomly firing bullets and must be killed
- Other obstacles like asteroids?
- After a specific number of enemies are killed a boss enemy will appear that will fire more bullets and will take longer to kill
- Killing the boss will change the level
- Powerups?
- Second level will have moving enemies
- Background music different for every level
- Sound of bullets

**18th October:**

- I selected all the images to be used in the game:
  - homescreen background
  - three level backgrounds
  - three enemy spaceships
  - three boss spaceships
  - lasers/bullets
  - blast
  
- Found sounds and music:
  - background music for home screen
  - backround music for three levels
  - laser/bullet sounds for player and enemy
  - blast sound
