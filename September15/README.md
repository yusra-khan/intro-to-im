- I tried to base my portrait on my bitmoji.
- I was surprised with the amount of trial and error involved.
- The part of my self-portrait whose implementation was the most difficult to figure out was the hijab. I tried many different things before I reached a method that gave a satisfactory result.
- I have only used line, arc and basic shapes in the entire process.
- I used [Paletton](https://paletton.com/) to figure out rgb values of different colors.
