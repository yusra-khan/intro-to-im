## Game using OOP in Processing Assignment

View the game as video [here](https://youtu.be/Y06vj3BQODQ)

- The whole implementation for the Game class was tricky but once I had i figured it out it was pretty easy to code
- I added the circles in the background for the home screen to make it more visually appealing
- I consulted the bouncing ball code discussed in class
- Bouncing it off all the bricks as well as the walls and the paddle was kinda tricky
- Sorry for the sloppy video quality, I have windows and it doesn't have a screen-record feature
